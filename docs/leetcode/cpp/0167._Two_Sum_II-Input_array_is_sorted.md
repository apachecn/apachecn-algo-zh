## 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

难度：Easy

## 内容

原题链接：https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## 思路

关键点：

- 升序排列
- 一定有解

## 代码

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = numbers.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            if (sum < target) 
                left++;
            else if (sum > target) 
                right--;
            else 
                return {left + 1, right + 1};
        }
        return {0, 0};
    }
};
```
